# CENTER THIS DIV
This one is simple, but it's something that you'll want to do ALL THE TIME.  Might as well get it out of the way now.

All you need to do is center the red div inside the blue container.

## Desired Outcome

### Self Check
- Is the red div centered?
Yes the box was centered 
- Did you _only_ use flexbox to center it?
No, I used margin but quickly realized when inspecting the element in chrome why it was not practical.
